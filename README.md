# endeavouros-flatwallpapers

## Overview
* A collection of simple EndeavourOS themed wallpapers that I made using Inkscape.
* The wallpapers come in a set of two: one dark themed and one light themed.
  * So far there are only versions of officially supported desktop environments / window managers (of which I could find a useable logo) as well as one general set without any icons.

## Installation
Since these are just wallpapers, you can just clone the repository using **git** (or just download the .zip archive using the Code button in the upper right corner); just to be safe, make sure you're in a fitting directory already (Downloads folder, maybe your home directory, etc.)

```
git clone https://github.com/Reoesque/endeavouros-flatwallpapers/
```

You will then have a directory in which there are subdirectories for each desktop environment / window manager.

## Credits / Copyright notice
First of all: this is a simple wallpaper set.

If you see your own copyright violated or do not want me to distribute these wallpapers, please make sure to contact me, so that I can take the necessary measures and remove the specific wallpapers from the repository as I do not own any of the necessary copyrights. I am trying my best to make sure that I give credit where its due.
